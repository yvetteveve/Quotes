       <h1>Amountain Gorillas</h1>
       <p>The world’s smallest population of mountain gorillas—a subspecies of the eastern gorilla—is split in two and scientists have debated whether they may be two separate subspecies.
           A bit more than half live in the Virunga Mountains, a range of extinct volcanoes that border the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda and Uganda.
           The remainder can be found in the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park in Uganda. Since the discovery of the mountain gorilla subspecies in 1902,
           its population has endured years of war, hunting, habitat destruction and disease—threats so severe that it was once thought the species might be extinct by the end of the twentieth century.</p>

        <h1>Recovery in progress</h1>

        <p>Despite years of civil unrest in the region where mountain gorillas live, conservation efforts have found success. The gorilla population increased from 620 animals in 1989 to around 880 today</p>

        h1>Wildlife and climate change</h1>

        <p>To increase chances of conservation success, we must understand traits that make an individual species especially resilient or vulnerable to changes in climate.
           Different species will be affected in different ways; sometimes negatively, but not always.<
