        <h1>Macda Coffee Shop</h1>
    <p>Macda coffee shop is the tucked away at the back of what looks like an office building and,
       while it is a nice enough place, it doesn’t have the cozy-factor of some of Kigali’s other coffee
       but the lack of an outdoor sitting area is a big minus in a city with such great weather and views</p> .

    <h2>Services</h2>

    <p>Macda coffee it makes up for in service, food and drinks. The menu is slightly more creative than Bourbon,
       and The chicken pesto sandwich looked very familiar but they managed to pull it off without the use of smelly sock cheese.
       The iced mocha was delicious because they went a bit overboard when I asked for some extra chocolate in it
       The drink was almost black because of all of the chocolate they added in. For me, this was a great, great thing
       I had gone to Magda to soak up some of their free wifi and was disappointed to find a working, but very crappy connection</p>

     <p>about Macda coffee is their coffee. When I’m eating a wonderful, amazing cake o’ deliciousness,
        At Macda coffee the only coffee choice you have is ‘with milk’ or ‘without milk’.
        I realise they’re more of a bakery and sandwich place than a full on cafe but fancy cakes should come with fancy coffees.<p/>
